Minimal Danmaku
===============

For Ludum Dare Jam 26, I and a friend are working on a danmaku (bullet
hell) game with a minimalist story. The protagonist is a man (or
whatever) seeking to throw out his sources of stress and become more
content with his life. Enemies and bosses represent sources of stress,
and the player's firepower is proportional to how stressed you
are. Your stress decreases by defeating bosses, and so you become
weaker as the game progresses. At the end, you confront (and hopefully
overcome) your original self.

Development is in Lua, using love2d. Neither of us know Lua, so this
code is probably horrific. Apologies.
